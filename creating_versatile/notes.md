# [Creating Versatile AI Agents Through Wasm+Rust - Miley Fu, WasmEdge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S4tDcdjWxU&list=PLeb33PCuqDde8NiI_am5g7b2WWnyggE5t&index=10)

- A lot of LLM research and models tend to be open source.
- Rust is a popular language, which is accoreding to StackOverflow the language that delelopers most admire.
- Main features of Rust for AI development are:
  - Memory safety.
  - Concurency.
  - No Python dependency (*IMHO: wtf is this doing here.*).
- WASM features are:
  - Fast execution.
  - Security.
  - Write once, run anywhere.
  - Simplifies deployment.
- WASM and WebGPU are mode to abstract away and unify hardware and software stacks.
- LlamaEdge: a way to run LLM models locally on WASM.
