# [Creating a Linear Algebra library from scratch in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTumOVDSSzk&list=PLeb33PCuqDde8NiI_am5g7b2WWnyggE5t&index=21)

## Matrix

- Representation: dynamic. Just a vector of vectors.
- To create a matrix, library should have: creating literally in code, loading from files.
- It should be possible to clone a matrix.
- Matrix should be able to be printed.
- Make an identity matrix.
- `apply` method: like a map method.
- `dot` with other matrix.
- Users should be able to get row reducted row and Echelon form.
- Determinant calculation.
- Inverses of a matrix.
