# [Building Serverless AI Workflows with Wasm+Rust - Miley Fu, WasmEdge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH_oQJjYZHE&list=PLeb33PCuqDde8NiI_am5g7b2WWnyggE5t&index=10)

## Problems in developing AI applications

- Generic LLMs are not as smart, not really customizable, not a fit for a specific field.
- Apps on top of OpenAI ChatGPT are expensive.
- Data leaks and privacy concerns with remote LLM providers.
- Censorship in models and model biases.
- Typical AI applications rely a lot on complex cloud infrastructure.
- It's hard to manage AI dependencies.
- Python is not the performant language.

*IMHO: arguments on WASM are strange. How could it replace Docker...... Use WASM because 0 python dependency. Sorry, but how?*
