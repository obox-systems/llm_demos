# CONDUCTIVITY OF Li2Ge7O15:Me3+ SINGLE CRYSTALS

Lithium heptagermanate (Li2Ge7O15) is one of the promising materials for devices of
solid-state ionics. Recently, it has been shown that variation of chemical composition,
nanometer size structuring and doping with aliovalent impurities represent effective ways to
increase ionic conduction in Li2Ge7O15 [1-3]. In this work we report the data on studying ionic
conductivity in Li2Ge7O15 single crystals doped with trivalent metal ions Me3+ (Me3+=Cr, Al,
Gd, Eu). The single crystals studied were grown by Czhochralskii method, the dopants Cr (0.1
% wt), Al (0.15 % wt), Gd (0.03 % wt), Eu (0.05 % wt) were added to the initial mixture of
reagents before the synthesis of the charge for the crystal growth. The samples were prepared
as the plane parallel plates with dimensions of about 5×5mm2 and widths near 1 mm. Pt
electrodes were sputtered on the sample’s main planes in an Ar atmosphere. Electrical
conductivity was measured in AC field by using AC bridge E7-10 and LCR-Meter Keysight
E4980AL.
Study of conductivity in Li2Ge7O15 single crystals revealed that above ~500 K σ became
strongly anisotropic. Along [100] crystallographic direction σ was more than in one order of
magnitude higher than conductivity along [001] and in two orders of magnitude higher as
compared with σ measured along [010]. Study of conductivity in doped crystals
Li2Ge7O15:Me3+ shown that small amounts of the used dopants strongly changed the typical
values and anisotropy character of conductivity. Doping with chromium and aluminum notably
increased conductivity and vice versa, introducing Gd and Eu impurities significantly decreased
σ. Representing the experimental data in Arrhenius coordinates σ(1/T) made it possible to
calculate the activation energy Ua and attempting frequency -1 of the charge transfer in the
studied crystals. For pure and doped crystals Ua was in the range (0.94 – 1.27) eV.
The obtained results are explained by considering the crystal structure, the impurity
centers charge state and location in the lattice. It was shown that the doping effects were
determined by the nature of the charge compensating defects. If the doping was accompanied
by appearance of charge compensating lithium interstitials ALi, conductivity of the single
crystals increased (Cr and Al dopants). When the charge imbalance introduced by impurity (Gd,
Eu) was compensated by lithium vacancies VLi, doping significantly decreased σ. The obtained
data testify that charge transfer in Li2Ge7O15 crystal is determined by mobile lithium interstitials
moving through the structural channels
